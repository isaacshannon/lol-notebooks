    Using randomized zoom augmentation to locate players on the mini-map was very effective.

    I built the desktop AI machine. Excellent results were achieved at predicting if a small 10x10 image has a player
    when a 30x30 image is used to guess if the center 10x10 has a player.

    Splitting the map into many small pieces and predicting if each one of those contains a character has proven
    to be the best way to get the coordinates of each character on the map, requiring far less manual tagging
    than straight labelling or points.

    Reducing the LR to 1e-4

    Generating an entire map is too resource intensive, after 4 hours of training with ~5k images the results are mediocre.
    I will have too switch to a grid output or similar.

    Another option is to predict the position of every player, ordered by closest to top corner. This would scale really well because only 10 coordinates are required at any time.

    Predicter had to be dropped to a LR  (1e-6,1e-3) -> (1e-6,1e-4).
    BS was increased from 32 -> 64 and LR returned to 1e-3. Goota go to bed, will test tomorrow.

    Non-blended predictions look pretty decent

    DUal team predictions are confusing and difficult to predict. Going to remodel using a 5x5 grid instead of 10x10,
    and no distinction between teams.
